# Motorway Project

## NOTES

1. **Repository name change**
    - The repository was previously named `motorway` and has since been renamed to `python-framework`. As a result, some of the screenshots or references may still reflect the old name. Please disregard any inconsistencies.

2. **Correction in `car_input - V5.txt`**
    - The file initially contained a registration number that appeared to be incorrect: **BM57 BOW**
    - I updated it to **BW57 BOF** to match the registration number in `car_output - V5.txt`

3. **Helper function for formatting registration numbers**
    - I created a helper function named `add_space_after_numbers` (located in `common/common_functions.py`) to ensure
      proper formatting of registration numbers
    - This function adds a space after the two numbers in a registration number (e.g. **KT17DLX** becomes **KT17 DLX**)
    - Without this function, the test fails during assertion because the registration number format does not match the
      data in `car_output - V5.txt`

### Prerequisites

To run the tests, ensure the following are installed and configured:

- **Git**: Required for cloning the repo
- **PyCharm**: The IDE I used for running and debugging the tests
- **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher is required
- **Chrome browser**: This is specified in the config file (located in `config/CONFIG_FILE.json`)

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Run the following command in your terminal or
command prompt:

```
git clone https://github.com/ghufrankhan/python-framework.git
```

### Setup

Open up the project in **PyCharm**

#### Create Virtual Environment

To configure the Python interpreter for the project in PyCharm, follow these steps:

1. In **PyCharm**, navigate to **Settings**:
    - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Settings...` on macOS)

2. In the Settings window:
    - Navigate to **Project: motorway** > **Python Interpreter**

3. Add a Local Interpreter:
    - Click on the gear icon next to the interpreter dropdown
    - Select **Add Local Interpreter...**

4. Create venv:
    - Location should be `.../motorway/venv`
    - Click **OK** (Ignore the error in the screenshot, the venv already exists for me)

5. Correct the Project Structure:
    - Navigate to **Project Structure** under **Project: motorway**.
        - Mark required folders as **Sources** (blue folders in the below screenshot)
        - Ensure `venv` is **not** marked as **Excluded**

6. Click **Apply** and then **OK**

#### Install requirements.txt to Virtual Environment

To install the required dependencies for the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Terminal** in PyCharm:
    - Click the **Terminal** icon at the bottom left of the PyCharm window

2. Confirm Virtual Environment status:
    - Ensure the terminal shows the prefix `(venv)` at the beginning of the prompt. This indicates that the virtual
      environment is active

3. Install the dependencies:
    - Run the following command in the terminal:
      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

    <img src="assets/pip-install.png" alt="Pip Install Screenshot" width="55%" />

    - This will install all the packages listed in `requirements.txt`

4. Verify the installation:
    - Once the command completes, all required packages will be installed in the virtual environment, and youâ€™re ready
      to run the project

### Running the Tests

#### Create a Run Configuration

To configure and run the tests in **PyCharm**, follow these steps:

1. Click on **Current File** in the top right corner of the **PyCharm** window

2. Select **Edit Configurations...** from the dropdown menu

#### Edit the Run Configuration

1. In the **Run/Debug Configurations** window:
    - Click the **+** icon and select **Python** <sup>[1]</sup>
    - Set the **Name** to `Run Tests` <sup>[2]</sup>

2. Configure the following settings:
    - Ensure a valid Python interpreter is selected (this is usually auto filled). Ideally, it should point to the
      virtual environment you created earlier (e.g. `.../motorway/venv/bin/python`) <sup>[3]</sup>
    - For **Script path**, select the `__main__.py` file located in the `behave` package within your virtual
      environment <sup>[4]</sup>
    - In **Script parameters**, add <sup>[5]</sup>:
      ```
      tests --no-capture --format progress2
      ```
    - Ensure the **Working directory** is set to the project root (e.g. `.../motorway`) <sup>[6]</sup>

3. Click **OK** to save the configuration

4. Run the tests:
    - Click the **Run** button (green play icon) to execute the tests
